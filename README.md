## NFL Sports Betting Analysis: Betting for Starters
## Stadium Type Analysis
### By: Justin Butler
 
For my section of our project, I chose to analyze how betting on an NFL game may be affected by the type of stadium the games are played in. Whether games played indoors in dome style stadiums are approached differently than games played outdoors in open-air style stadiums. Considering that harsher weather generally plays a factor on games by making it harder for teams to score. For e.g.: High wind speeds making it harder for the quarterbacks to throw to their receivers or more difficult for kickers to kick field goals and extra points after touchdowns.  From this topic I will analyze our group’s acquired data from the 2013 to 2023 NFL seasons and pose two more precise questions and in my conclusion make a recommendation on how I would bet on a future NFL game. Now let’s get into the data!

Question 1) –  Is stadium type, being either indoor or outdoor factored in when the over/under line is set for games ? 
To answer my questions I first used the value.counts() function on the stadium column in our csv data file, which contained the names of all the stadiums played in over the past 10 years to get the full stadium list so I could later filter it by indoor and outdoor and place these values in a newly created column titled “stadium_type”.  I used the following for loop to achieve the desired result:
